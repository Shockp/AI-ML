    "\n",
    "##### **Objective**\n",
    "Create a Python program that:\n",
    "1. Takes two vectors as input from the user.\n",
    "2. Performs operations such as:\n",
    "   - Addition ($\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}$)\n",
    "   - Subtraction ($\\mathbf{u} - \\mathbf{v}$)\n",
    "   - Scalar multiplication ($c\\mathbf{u}$)\n",
    "   - Dot product ($\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$)\n",
    "3. Visualizes the original vectors and the results of these operations on a 2D plane.\n",
    "4. Dynamically adjusts the axis scaling based on the input vectors.\n",
    "5. Saves the final visualization as an image file for future reference."

    "##### **Steps to Build**\n",
    "1. **Input Collection**:\n",
    "   - Accept vector inputs $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$.\n",
    "   - Accept a scalar value for multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Perform Operations**:\n",
    "   - Addition: $\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}$\n",
    "   - Subtraction: $\\mathbf{u} - \\mathbf{v}$\n",
    "   - Scalar Multiplication: $c\\mathbf{u}$\n",
    "   - Dot Product: $\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Visualization**:\n",
    "   - Plot the original vectors $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$.\n",
    "   - Plot their sum $\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}$, difference $\\mathbf{u} - \\mathbf{v}$, and scalar multiplication $c\\mathbf{u}$.\n",
    "   - Label each vector and ensure the axis scales dynamically.\n",
    "   - Annotate the origin and other key points for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Save the Plot**:\n",
    "   - Export the plot as an image file (e.g., `vector_visualization.png`)."
